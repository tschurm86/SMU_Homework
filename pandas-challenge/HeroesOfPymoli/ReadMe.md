Heroes of Pymoli

This data had several interesting trends. Given a total player pool of 576 and a total revenue of 2379.77:

1) Perhaps unsurprisingly, males make up the overwhelming majority of players at 84%. Along with making up the 
majority of players, males make up the majority of item purchases as well, totaling $1,967.64 or 82.68%.

2) The age group making the most purchases, and accounting for the most revenue, is the 20-24 age range. This 
group makes up 44.79% of the player pool, while making up 46.81% of the revenue.

3) The most popular items align closely to the most profitable ones. However, the fourth most popular item,
Persuasion, does not make the top five most profitable list. Deciphering why Persuasion is popular, and why
Singed Scalpel is so profitable, would be useful to maximizing profits across all items.
